# Demographic Data Analyzer
In this repository, I analyze demographic data using Pandas.
## While Analyzing, we develop answers for the following questions:
*  How many people of each race are represented in this dataset?  
*  What is the average age of men?  
*  What is the percentage of people who have a Bachelor's degree?  
*  What percentage of people wwith advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) make more than 50K?  
*  What percentage of people without advanced education make more than 50K?  
*  What is the minimum number of hours a person works per week?  
*  What percentage of the people who work the minimum number of hours per week have a salary of more than 50K?  
*  What country has the highest percentage of people that earn >50K and what is that percentage?  
*  Identify the most popular occupation for those who earn >50K in India.
